# Me, Mineself, and I

## Overview

A platformer game made with Python using the Arcade library. 

You are a miner wanting to collect all of the rocks, gems, and coal. There is a counter of all the items you have left to find in the cave. When this counter reaches 0 you have completed the level! (currently only one level).

Run around, collect gems and rocks, and don't touch the lava!
